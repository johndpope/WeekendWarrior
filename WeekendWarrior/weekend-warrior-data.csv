Vegetation is predominantly thick chaparral with forests of ponderosa pine occupying high ridges. A stand of Douglas-fir grows on the sheltered north slope of Cottonwood Peak the highest in the range. The granite cliffs buttes and ridges of the Santa Teresas lend themselves to the weathering forces of nature in such a way that in many places they have been sculpted into strikingly picturesque formations.

Washington intended to locate it atop the 10649 foot San Bernardino Peak but determined that the summit was not visible from the valley below so he established the point half a mile west 350 feet lower in elevation but more visible from the west. He built a tower at the site a 25-foot tall pole rising from a pile of rocks with dangling tin reflectors to make the point even more visible from below.

284,Snow Mountain Wilderness,,None,-122.738228,39.415702,The Wilderness Act of 1984 established 23 new wilderness areas including the 60000-acre Snow Mountain Wilderness in the Mendocino National Forest. The Snow Mountain Wilderness straddles the summit of the North Coast Range within Colusa Glenn and Lake counties. The area is less than a four-hour drive from San Francisco Santa Rosa and Sacramento.The central feature of this wilderness is the large broad topped Snow Mountain which drains water toward the Sacramento River on the east and the Eel River Basin on the west. The wilderness also has the largest known waterfall on the forest. Elevations range from 1800 feet in the gorge of the Middle Fork of Stony Creek to 7056 feet on the summit of East Snow Mountain Peak. The deep canyons skirting the Wilderness compress ecological life zones creating a unique biological sky-island.Forty miles of trail are located in the wilderness. This leaves a vast amount of acreage very remote and highly conducive to cross-country exploration. The moderate hike to the top of East Peak affords visitors a magnificent view of the Sacramento Valley and the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the east Clear Lake to the southwest the Coastal Mountains to the west and the timbered mountains of the Mendocino National Forest to the North.Good drinking water is scarce in the Snow Mountain Wilderness during much of the summer. Plan ahead and refill canteens at every opportunity. Mountain streams may look inviting but they may not be safe for drinking. Treat all water for drinking and cooking by either processing through a portable water filter or by boiling over a portable cook stove.Vegetation in the Snow Mountain Wilderness ranges from chaparral on the low elevation slopes to black oak and mixed conifer at the mid-elevations. In the crest zone thick stands of true fir weather-shaped Jeffrey pine and incense cedar exist around natural openings of bare rock and erosion pavement. At the dry lower slopes hikers will find scattered patches of lupine golden eardrops coyote mint and Indian paintbrush. As hikers progress up they will encounter scattered moist meadows and streams which are accented by scarlet and yellow monkey flowers and other colorful moist-site herbs. As they reach the exposed rocky ridges wild buckwheat penstemon wild onion purple monkey flowers and pussy paws are more common.The rocks that constitute Snow Mountain were originally formed during the Mesozoic era and are composed of sedimentary rocks such as sandstone shale and thin beds of chert.After the formation of the rocks mountain building forces deformed and faulted the rocks into their present position. The lower flanks of the Snow Mountain area consist of sedimentary rocks while the upper portions of the mountain consist of greenstone. In addition to these rocks small amounts of serpentinite are found which may be remnants of the original ocean crust or may be later intrusions along the fault plane.The north slopes on the upper elevations of the wilderness underwent glaciation during the Pleistocene era which created small flat meadows. Today some of these areas are wet with abundant vegetation while others are dry and sparsely vegetated.Map showing recreational areas.

The area has been described as a rugged land containing steep canyons with long gentle ridges in between. It was named in honor of the Yuki Tribe who once called this area home. Management of the area is shared between the Mendocino National Forest and the Bureau of Land Management Arcata Field Office.The Yuki Wilderness ranges in elevation from almost 6500 feet near Windy Gap in the southeast to roughly 1150 feet along the Middle Fork Eel River. When visiting the Yuki you will experience a wide variety of vegetation including grasslands chaparral thickets oak groves and forests of Shasta red fir white fir Jeffrey pine sugar pine ponderosa pine Douglas-fir and incense cedar. Six of California's fifteen species of oaks are found within the Yuki Wilderness.If you visit during the spring months the Yuki will delight you with its spectacular wildflower displays! The Middle Fork Eel Wild and Scenic River flows through the northwestern portion of the Yuki Wilderness and is home to rainbow trout and threatened runs of steelhead and Chinook salmon. It is estimated that the river supports over one-third of California's remaining summer-run steelhead trout population. In addition many interesting animals call the area home including bald eagle pine marten goshawk northern spotted owl prairie falcon river otter beaver tule elk mountain lion black bear porcupine ringtail gray fox badger golden eagle blue grouse and pileated woodpecker.Good drinking water is scarce in the Yuki Wilderness. Although streams may look inviting and harmless they may not be safe for drinking. Many of the areaâ€™s waters contain Giardia lambia a microscopic organism which when ingested can cause nausea abdominal cramps flatulence lethargy diarrhea and weight loss. Giardia can be readily transmitted between humans and animals. Feces (human or animal waste) can contain the disease; waste should be buried 6 to 8 inches deep and at least 100 feet away from natural waters.Treat all water for drinking and cooking by either processing through a portable water filter or by boiling over a portable cook stove for 3 to 5 minutes.Poison oak is commonly found throughout the Yuki Wilderness. Contact with this plant at any time of year may cause an itchy painful rash. Contact with this plant or with animals that may have brushed against this plant should be avoided.Rattlesnakes are also common in the area. If bitten remain calm immobilize the bitten extremity and send someone to get medical assistance. If alone walk slowly resting periodically and using a makeshift crutch if a lower extremity is involved. Keep activity to a minimum.Ticks carrying Lyme disease commonly inhabit lower elevation brush fields. Be sure to check for ticks and remove any imbedded ticks immediately.Wilderness permits are not required however a campfire permit is required. Campfire permits can be picked up at any Forest Service office at no charge.If you get lost stay calm and try to remember how you got to your present location. Look for familiar landmarks trails or streams. If you are injured near exhaustion or it's dark stay where you are; someone may be looking for you. If you decide to go on do it slowly. Try to find a high point with a good view and then plan your route of travel. When you find a trail stay on it. If you stay lost follow a drainage downstream. If a person in your party gets injured treat the injury if you can and make the victim comfortable. Send or signal for help. If you must go for help leave one person with the injured and do not move until help arrives unless there is more danger in remaining where you are.Map showing recreational areas.

Most of the Forest is open to those who prefer to camp in an undeveloped setting. This type of camping is called ""dispersed camping""Â and visitors are asked to choose a fire safe campsiteÂ and to leave a minimal impact on the site.A current California Campfire Permit is required to use a camp stove barbecue or have a campfire outside of developed areas. Abide by the terms and instructions listed on your campfire permit. Remember local Forest fire restrictions in effect will supersede the campfire permit so inquire at the Forest Service Ranger Station nearest your destination before building or maintaining a campfire.Always locate your campfire barbeque or campstove away from brush trees or overhanging limbs. Be sure to clear away flammable vegetation from your campfire for a radius of at least five feet down to bare mineral soil; never start or maintain a campfire on a windy day; and use plenty of water and stir to completely drown your fire before leaving. Never leave a campfire unattended even for one moment - extinguish it completely before leaving camp. Submerge your used barbeque brickets in a pail of water and then dispose them in the center of your campfire ring.Always practice ""pack it in-pack it out"" camping. Â Plan ahead for the collection and storage of your trash and take it with you when you leave. Â Please do not litter burn or bury trash in the forest.Likewise it is your responsibility to manage human waste. There are many commercial products on the market to deal with human waste. If you must bury it be sure to dig a hole at least 6 inches or more down into soil and stay at least 100 feet away from any river lake stream spring or trail. Never bury toilet paper or sanitary products. Animals can dig it up and scatter it around the area.You may collect ""dead and down"" campfire wood for your camp trip. Â Please do not damage trees or vegetation to create a campsite orÂ dig trenches for a tent platform.You may disperse camp in any one location for 14 days and you may stay a total of 21 days per year on the National Forest. When you go home leave the forest the way you found it or better for the enjoyment of the next visitor.Areas for Dispersed Camping at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Lake and Pond Fishing at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for River and Stream Fishing at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Day Hiking at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Backpacking at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Horse Camping at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Horse Riding at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for OHV Camping at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for OHV Road Riding at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for OHV Trail Riding at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Interpretive Areas at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Visitor Centers at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Picnicking at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Group Picnicking at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Boating - Motorized at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Boating - Non-Motorized at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Swimming at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Waterskiing at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Windsurfing at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Skiing/Snowboarding at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for XC Skiing/Snowshoeing at Highway 108 CorridorAreas for Snowmobiling at Highway 108 Corridor"

431,Ben Tyler Trail #606,,None,-105.5919139,39.43604064,Topographic map for Ben Tyler trail of the Lost Creek Wilderness in the Pike National ForestThe Craig Park Trail #608 lies in a long high mountain valley between the Kenosha Mountains and Platte River Mountains. This open east-west valley is the beginning point of Craig Creek and the trail follows along the north side of the Creek. The western terminus of the trail is a junction with the Ben Tyler Trail and its eastern terminus is a junction with the Brookside/McCurdy Trail. The Craig Park Trail itself is a very gradual and easy hike. However to reach the trail you must hike up either the Brookside/McCurdy Trail or the Ben Tyler Trail. Craig Creek offers good opportunities for fishing for brook trout. Because the trail is entirely in designated wilderness Wilderness regulations apply.
432,Goose Creek Trail #612,,None,-105.3761197,39.17257241,Section of the Pike National Forest map showing the Lost Creek WildernessÂ area.The Goose Creek Trail (#612) provides access into the southeast portion of the Lost Creek Wilderness. The trail winds north and eventually ends in Wigwam Park at a junction with the Wigwam Trail (#609). The Goose Creek Trail offers primitive camping fishing in Goose Creek and viewsÂ of red Pikes Peak granite formations. A popular day hike is up the lower Goose Creek Trail to a side trail leading to several historic buildings and the remains of a shaft house. These old buildings and machinery date back to the late 1800's/early 1900's when a company attempted without success to create a reservoir by sealing the underground channel of the Lost Creek. Above the shafthouse the creek is Lost Creek but it emerges from underground just south of the shafthouse as Goose Creek.The McCurdy Park Trail intersects the Goose Creek Trail where it begins to climb north out of the Lost Creek drainage. AÂ multi-day loopÂ trip is to hike the Goose Creek Trail up to the McCurdy Park Trail (#628) and follow the McCurdy Park TrailÂ to its intersection with the Brookside Trail (#607). ThenÂ continue south a short distance to the Lake Park Trail (#639). Follow the Lake Park Trail to Hankins Pass and then travel east on the Hankins Pass Trail (#630)Â back to the Goose Creek Trailhead.The lower part of the valley is rather tight and good legal campsites (at least 100' from water and the trail) are scarce.Â Â Plan to begin hiking from the trailhead early enough to find a good campsite. This area sees heavy use so do all you can to keep your impact to a minimum. Because the trail is entirely in designated wilderness Wilderness regulations apply.There is a mandatory self-issuing permit system in the Mount Evans and Lost Creek Wilderness areasÂ to enable us to better manage visitation. The same type of system isÂ also in place in other Wildernesses. The intent is to use the data obtained through the permit system to more accurately assess the amounts and types of existing Wilderness use. ThisÂ enables us to better preserve their natural condition for future generations balanced against the pressures of growing populations and increased use. These permits have no quotas associated with them nor are thereÂ any fees required to obtain them. TheyÂ are available free at each trailhead. As you enter the Wilderness fill out the provided permit and deposit theÂ stub in the slot in the lower front of the register box. Keep theÂ permit in your possession and please follow the Wilderness regulations found on the back.

Its northern terminus is the Payne Creek/Brookside Trailhead near Bailey and its southern terminus is the Twin Eagles Trailhead southeast of the Tarryall Reservoir. About midway between these two trailheads the Brookside-McCurdy Trail passes through the Lost Park Trailhead. Along the way it connects with nine other trails providing numerous opportunities to create loop trips of various lengths. Throughout its length this trail presents the hiker with a wide variety of the different landscapes found in the Lost Creek Wilderness including different forest types wide-open parks wild formations of red Pikes Peak granite and the tremendous views found along the ridge between Bison Peak and McCurdy Park. Deer elk and bighorn sheep are some of the wildlife that can be seen along the trail.

After 0.45 miles take a left at the Y. Go 2.2 miles to the trailhead on the left (south) side of the road.This trail is open year round; however weather may make access difficult especially in the winter and spring months.Starting from the Payne Creek/Brookside Trailhead the trail rises gently and soon reaches the junction at which the Payne Creek and Brookside-McCurdy trails diverge. The Payne Creek Trail goes left and then swings southeast on its way to join the Colorado Trail. The Brookside-McCurdy continues south climbing gradually at first and then steepening as it climbs the Platte River Range. After crossing the boundary of the Lost Creek Wilderness the trail eventually meets the Brookside AG Trail which rises up from the west after leaving MacArthur Gulch.Â Check with the South Platte District office for current informationÂ regarding the Brookside AG Trail. From the junction the Brookside trail continues to climb up and over into Craig Park where it intersects with the Craig Park Trail.The next segment rises south out of Craig Park over a saddle and then descends into North Lost Park where it leaves the Wilderness and joins the Colorado Trail. A couple of miles down valley from this junction the North Fork Trailhead is reached where the two trails part. The Colorado Trail runs east and north to the Rolling Creek Trailhead on the northeast side of the wilderness and the Brookside-McCurdy veers south following North Lost Creek to the Lost Park Trailhead.From Lost Park the trail goes south across Lost Creek to a junction with the Wigwam Trail. The Wigwam Trail goes left (east) through the Wilderness to the east side at the Wigwam Trailhead. The Brookside-McCurdy continues south and soon re-enters the Wilderness then follows Indian Creek upstream to a high saddle between the Lost Creek and Tarryall Creek drainages where it meets the Ute Creek Trail climbing up from the south. Here the trail swings southeast continuing to climb for a short distance to its high point on the southwest shoulder of Bison Peak. From the high point the trail follows a ridge to the southeast through the remnants of an old burn. This stretch has tremendous views to the south and west particularly in the fall but be aware of your exposure to lightening from summer afternoon storms. Eventually the trail drops down to the pass at the south end of McCurdy Park and meets the McCurdy Park Trail coming up from the north.On the last segment of the Brookside-McCurdy Trail it descends a short distance to another junction this time with the Lake Park Trail. The Lake Park Trail rises to the east and then drops south to Hankins Pass. The Brookside-McCurdy drops steeply south leaving the Wilderness to a junction with the Hankins Pass Trail which extends east toward the Goose Creek Trailhead. One last gentle downhill leg brings you out at the Twin Eagles Trailhead.

It is a relatively gentle trail overall climbing gradually through ponderosa and lodgepole pine forests and an aspen grove created by a 135 acre fire in 1926. It then descends into open meadows along Craig Creek. Payne Creek is named for Jim Payne who once logged the area and had a mill two miles up the creek from the Platte River. Payne and others logged all the way up the valley to the divide between Payne Creek and Craig Creek in the late 1800's and early 1900's. There are sites suitable for overnight camping in Craig Meadows.

The Thunder Mountain trail is a moderate to high use ATV trail located in a remote are on the Cascade Ranger District.Â  The trail was inspected on October 28 2014.Â  The trail was impassible due to several washouts located on the first stream crossing up from the 440 road. Â Construction was started in 2014.The project is located in a burn area and on 30 to 40 percent slope.Â  The current conditions of the trail are very hazardous and are detrimental to the creeks water quality.Â  The trail climbs from the 440 road at an approximate grade of 20+ percent.There are many springs that cross the trail and two 30 foot corduroys that are failing.Â  The soil consists of mostly decomposed granite with little or no rock available for use in reconstruction.Â  The creek appears to run year round and there is evidence of several high water events in recent history.Additionally the creek appears to be migrating and continuing to stabilize in its channel. At the creek crossing the trail is washed out on both sides of the creek with an additional washout on the southeast end.Â Â  The washouts are approximately 20-33 feet in length and extend all the way to the creek channel.Two of the washouts are about 60- 70 feet in height and all are very unstable due to continuing erosion and flooding.Â  To improve public safety and reduce further resource damage the following actions were proposed.A 1.2 mile reroute after the steel bridge crossing.Â  Decommission of 1.3 miles of the old trail to eliminate erosion in to Riorden Creek.This eliminated one creek crossing and uses the existing infrastructure of the current trail system in the area. Construction of sustainable trail with lower grades and improved drainage will reduce the future maintenance needs and costs of the trail.Â  Additionally this will improve public safety and reduce resource damage to the area. Due to the very remote location of the trail the logistics of transporting in equipment and supplies was very complicated.We were greatly assisted by Lucky Peak Helitack and Emmett Rough Riders Boise Kuna and Canyon County ATV Clubs and Idaho Department of Recreation.Map showing recreational areas.

Straddling the divide between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan this region ranges from nearly level terrain to rocky cliffs. McCormick's water is what draws most visitors with the Huron Dead Pahokee and the Wild and Scenic Yellow Dog Rivers all have part of their headwaters within the wilderness. Many cascading waterfalls on the Yellow Dog make it unnavigable. The Yellow Dog is one of a few Eastern rivers designated ""Wild"". Eighteen small lakes add sparkle to the landscape. Trout pike and bass live here but only in small numbers due to the less-than-fertile-waters. The three mile White Lake Trail connects County Road 607 to White Deer Lake where the McCormick Estate once stood. Remnants of old unmaintained trails can sometimes be found but the rest of the Wilderness is fairly rugged isolated unspoiled and relatively difficult to access.McCormick WildernessFrom Marquette Mi.

1340,Sandia Ranger District,,Open,-106.384027,35.073946,"Just east of Albuquerque are the most visited mountains in New Mexico. Millions of people journey into the Sandia Mountains each year. More than half these visitors ride the Sandia Peak Tram or drive the Sandia Crest National Scenic Byway to take in spectacular panoramic views of Central New Mexico and to enjoy many other recreational opportunities. The Sandia Crest Scenic Byway 536Â has several newly remodeled picnic grounds with shelters and group areas for reservation.The National Fee Project is currently in operation for all developed sites on the Scenic Byway and along the west and north sides of the district inthe Juan Tabo Basin and Las Huertas Canyon Areas. A daily amenity fee of $3.00 is required for all vehicles parking in designated developed recreation sites around the District. An annual pass is favorable with particular support given to the concept of fees staying available to the unit where they are collected.Â  The annual Sandia Ranger District Amenity pass is $30.00 and can be purchased at the Sandia Ranger Station Tijeras NM the Forest Service Supervisor's Office Albuquerque NM and REI Albuquerque NM.The Sandias are part of the signature of Albuquerque's unique sense of place. They serve as a premier refuge to a population of over 700000 people in the extended metropolitan area. Over one-third of the State's school-age population lives within an hour's drive of the Sandias and there is a great demand for fire prevention fire ecology and other environmental education programs.Sandia Mountain is a landmark in the spiritual universe of many active traditional Indian beliefs. It is regularly visited for ceremonial purposes by the Sandia Pueblo and at least annually by many other pueblos. It also has direct ties to Spanish land grant communities established by the King of Spain in the 1700's and Mexican land grants from the 1820's. Some Spanish land grants adjoining the Sandias are still active.Water sources are not only sacred to Indian beliefs but also played a key role in sustaining the agricultural bases of the land grant communities. Several ditch systems still function today including one actively maintained in Las Huertas Canyon as an ""acequia madre"" for a community's agricultural water. These traditional communities are encountering greater conflicts with the growing recreational uses of the Sandias.The lesser-known southern part of the District includes the Manzanita Mountains which form a low ridge between the Sandias to the north and the Manzano Mountains to the south.TheÂ Tijeras Pueblo Archaeological SiteÂ is located behind the Sandia Ranger Station office.Â The Friends of the Tijeras Pueblo maintain and provide education through the use of a monthly lecture series which meets at the Sandia Ranger Station every second Tuesday of the month.A portion of this area is in the Military Withdrawal where public use has been restricted since 1943. The Military Withdrawal and adjacent Forest Service land is currently the subject of intensive ecosystem planning to reduce fuel loads and the risk of wildfire to enhance wildlife habitat and ecosystem health.In many ways wildlife fish and rare plants are the measure of our success as ecosystem managers. Species diversity and abundance relate to ecosystem health. The District wildlife program features habitat enhancement projects inventory and monitoring of emphasis species and informative and education. The program relies heavily on the support of partnership groups such as the Albuquerque Wildlife Federation Hawk Watch International Central New Mexico Audubon Society Sandia Mountain Bear Watch and the New Mexico Habitat Stamp program; the wildlife program is integrated into fire/fuels recreation and forest health project objectives and Quivira Coalition.From the Albuquerque drive East on I-40 and exit at Exit 175.

The Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail (PCT) enters from Stevens Pass on the north to follow the crest south with a long westward bend to Snoqualmie Pass a distance of 67 trail miles.More than 700 lakes and mountain ponds dot the glacier-carved terrain of this wilderness. Tree covered valleys give way to rocky ridges and rugged peaks along the crest of the Cascades.Â  Many peaks and slopes are permanently cloaked in snowfields. From wet forests of Douglas fir cedar and an understory of salal and berries to firs and mountain hemlock the landscape opens up to expansive meadows matted with low growth and ends with dry forestland of ponderosa pine and grasses.The Enchantment Lakes area contains the Cashmere Crags which rate among the best rock-climbing sites in the western United States. Some of the names may cause you to think twice before heading up: Bloody Tower Cruel Thumb Cynical Pinnacle or Crocodile Fang.
